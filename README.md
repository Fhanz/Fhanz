- 👋 Hi, I’m Marco, (aka 'Fhanz'), a random student from the Catholic University of Chile
- 👀 I’m interested in Biotechnology, Bioinformatics, Electronics, General physics, Engineering Maths, and general topics related to STEM disciplines!.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning advanced python programming, and the basics of html5 and Julia.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to my interests (if multi-disciplinary, better).
- 📫 You can reach me via institutional e-mail marco.a.gaymer@uc.cl
